# Athena's Armor Set Hiryu Fix

A fix for Hiryu armor set not appearing even when "Allow Japanese-Only DLC" toggled. I went ahead and made it appear on default while there is not an update.

## Installation
1. Click the green "Clone or download" button and then "download ZIP"
2. Find your Athena's folder and just dump all the five files inside the /Data folder.
3. If you want to test if it's working, restart Athena's, try searching for a set with "Evade Extender", "Airborne" and "Stam Recov Up" and sorting it by family. Hiryu set should be the first one to show up.
